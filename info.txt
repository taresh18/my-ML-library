The folders contain the python file of the algorithm code, a notebook file, and a python file for preprocessing the data.
The code written is fully modularised. Comments are used to explain the code. The notebook demonstrates the working of
algorithm and also compares the accuracy with sklearn model.
The features implemented are:
   1. method to predict class with probabilities in logistic regression (probabilities of each class is calculated and the class 
      corresponding to maximum probability is chosen)
   2. method to report accuracy
   3. method to plot learning curves
   4. method to split the dataset into training and cross validation data
   5. mini batch gradient descent is implemented for linear and logistic regression
